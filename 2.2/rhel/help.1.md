# DESCRIPTION

The OrientDB image provides a containerized packaging of the OrientDB multi-model database. 
OrientDB is a 2nd Generation Distributed Graph Database with the flexibility of Documents in one product. 
It is a unique, true multi-model DBMS equipped to tackle todayâ€™s big data challenges and offers multi-master replication, 
sharding as well as more flexibility for modern, complex use cases. 

You can find more information on the OrientDB project from the project Web site (http://www.orientdb.com).
